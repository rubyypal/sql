and columns also called as attributes.

what is datawarehouse?
A datawarehouse is a large central location where data is managed and stored for analytical processing

There are two types of database
1.RDBMS-Relational database management system- It is a database where most of the tables are linked with each other.
2.NOSQL-It is type of database management system that is designed to handle and store large volumes of unstructured and semi structured data

DATATYPES
There are three main DATATYPES
1.String-char,varchar,text

2.Numeric-INT,TINYINT,BIGINT,FLOAT,Real etc

3.Date &Time-Date,Time,Datetime

How we accumulate data everyday
A data can be accumulated from different 'ENTITIES'

An entity can be machine,person,animal.An entity can be anything that is self descriptive.

There are 4 types of operators
1. comparision operator
2.logical operator
3.range & membership operator
4.airthmatic operator

COMPARISION OPERATOR 
It is a mathematical symbol allows to compare two values.
=,!=,<=,>=

Logical operator
AND-All the condition should satisfy
OR-Any one condition should satisfy

Range & Membership operator
IN

Membership operator
Sequence of numbers
Between,Not Between

Distinct
